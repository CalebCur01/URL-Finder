# URL-Finder
Using bs4 to parse websites for urls, lists each parent:child relationship, then create a directed graph of the relationships.

Choose a webpage to start from, a maximum number of links before quitting, and a maximum "depth" N to limit search. For example, if  N = 3 and www.foo.com -> www.bar.com -> www.bat.com -> www.baz.com, the program will stop collecting any further links from bar.com

Some example outputs:
