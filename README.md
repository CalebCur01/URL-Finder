# URL-Finder
Starting from one webpage, search for links to other webpages. 

Choose a webpage to start from, a maximum number of links before quitting, and a maximum depth For example, if  depth = 3 and www.foo.com -> www.bar.com -> www.bat.com -> www.baz.com, the program won't look for any further links after bat.com

Some example outputs:
